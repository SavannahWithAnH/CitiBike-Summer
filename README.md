# CitiBike-Summer

Please see my completed dashboard here LIIINKKKKKK

## Getting Started  
This dataset was very large, with over 1 million rows of data. For the purposes of publishing to Github, and calculating speed of Tableau, I used Python (Pandas) to read in the CSV file and take a sample of the data for visualization purposes. After selecting 30% of the data at random, I wrote the smaller dataset to a new CSV titled CitiBikeoutput. See the process below:

## Visualizing the data  
The questions I wanted to answer with this data are as follows:

-Who is cycling?  <br>
-What are the busiest rental hours during summer months (July & August)  <br>
-What bikes are utilized the most? (This could help with maintenance and upkeep)   <br>   
Additionally I wanted to visualize all of the stations with details, and over a period of time.
